---> War: The Card Game 
This version of war is a little bit more mild than the regular version in that when both players draw the same card, it is counted as a draw and they both keep their cards. Then both players discard a card again and the game continues. 
This game is played by two players. 
The objective of the game is to win more cards than your opponent once both card decks reach 0
The deck is divided evenly at the beginning and each turn results in one card being taken from the deck. 
The player whose card is higher, wins that round and keeps their card as well as the opponents card. 
Once both players run out of cards, whoever has more cards in their card pile wins the game. 

--->Technologies Used: 
JavaScript, HTML and CSS

--->Game Instructions: 
Click the start button to deal the game. The computer automatically goes first and will turn their card over. 
Player 2 goes next by clicking their deck, which will chose a random card to turn over. 
Whoever's card is higher, wins that round and the game contiues until both players card decks reach 0. 
Once both players no longer have any cards, the score is tallied and whoever has more cards in their discard pile wins the game. 
To reset the game at anytime press the "Reset Game Button" 


---> Next Steps/Future Enhancements: 
I would like to add a function for declaring war, when both players discard the same card. 
This would result in both players putting 1 card face down, and 1 card face up. Who ever has the higher face up card wins the "War" and takes all four cards (their 2 cards and the 2 cards of the opponent)
The game then continues like normal.
