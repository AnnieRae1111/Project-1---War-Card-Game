//Title of the page "Let's Play War "
// an area that says whether the player won or lost the turn 
// using the same area to also display when the entire game is won
// an area displaying the two decks of cards the player and the computer will click from 
// two "decks" displayed for each player. One with the cards face down, and the other, with the card they click face up 
// will need to randomly generate the card they click for their turn for their turn 
//Also need to render the deck of cards 
//make each deck be a different color on the back, so you can tell each player apart (use gradients)
// use css Flex to render the cards 


/*-------- //Setting up files for the game :// --------/* 

//Create a JS file for the deck that is seperate from the main logic script file? I read about this but not sure how to do it 
// so you can use the cards for any game, not just this one 


/*-------- //Pseudo Code:// --------/* 

//Will need to render the card deck/create the cards 
//define constant and state variables in a global scope 
    //const suits = ["hearts", "spades","daimonds", "clubs"]
    //const cardValues =[all the card values ]
    //let playerOne =
    //let computer =
    //let scorecore = 
    // create an array for the suits and the cardValues and combine them(use array.concat?)
//write  a function that shuffles the deck and turns over a card when the deck is clicked by player 
//write a function that takes one card awway from the deck when the deck is clicked by that player . 
    //each player starts with 26 cards, each time they click, the deck is reduced by one
//write a function that checks which card is higher aka who won the round 
//write a function for displaying  which player won for that round 
    //if playerOne's card is higher than computer, playerOne wins that round 
    //if playeOne's card is lower thancomputer, playerOne lost that round 
    //if computer card is higher than playerOne , computer wins that round 
    //if computer card is lower than playerOne, computer lost that round 
//write a function to declare who won the entire game when one player has all the cards 
//write a function for when both players draw the same card, the round is null and they put the cards back 
//write a function for when one player has all the cards they win the game
